<pre># exploring the file system

new execs in this lesson: `cd` + `touch` + `man` + `rm`

length: 30-40 mins

## what is a file system?
- a collection of files and directories
- directories can only hold files or other directories
- `Finder` is probably how you're most familiar to getting around a file system
	- show example with finder
- in the terminal, we have to use commands in order to navigate the file system
- in this lesson we'll learn how to do this!
- open your terminal!


## execute
`ls .`

see the dirs and files of your current dir


## execute
`cd Documents`

- `cd` stands for "change directory"
- english translation: "change directory to" "Documents"


## execute
`ls .`

- see the dirs and files of `Documents`
- compare to Finder


## execute
`cd ../`

- english translation: "change directory to" "parent directory"
- family relationships are used to describe file systems:
	- parent, child, sibling
	- show example of each relationship in Finder
- now we're in the same dir that we started


## execute
`ls .`

now we see that these are the same files and dirs that we had when we began


## creating and deleting files
- execute `touch hello.txt`
- english translation: "create a file" "called hello.txt" 

## was `hello.txt` was really created?
how can we check?

<ul class="fragment">
	<li>execute <code>ls .</code></li>
	<li>view in finder</li>
</ul>	


## execute
`rm hello.txt`

english translation: "ReMove" "hello.txt"

so...how can we make sure this file was deleted?

<div class="fragment">same as before!</div>


## command history
- you can press the "up arrow" key to cycle back through your history of executed commads
- use "down arrow" to cycle forward


## errors are your friend
- cycle through your history and get to the command `rm hello.txt`
- execute it
- the result is error: execute `rm: foo.txt: No such file or directory`
- we were telling the terminal to delete a file that doesnt exist, so the terminal let us know that this file doesnt exist


## creating directories
- execute `ls .`
	- we're going to create a new directory, so we want to make sure that it doesnt exist yet in our file system
- execute `mkdir hello`
	- english translation: "create a directory" "called 'hello'"


## command history
use terminal history ("up arrow") to get to `ls .` and execute it

make sure that the `hello` dir is there


## attempt to delete a directory
execute `rm hello`

- english translation: "remove" "hello">
- `rm: hello/: is a directory`
- what do we do...?


## execute
`man <exec>`

- english translation: "show me the MANual for" "any executable"
- lets use `man` to find out if we can use `rm` to delete dirs
- execute `man rm`
	- we're in a file-read mode!
	- this used to freak me out! i didnt know how to get out of it or what it was!
	- interface:
		- "space bar" => "scroll down"
		- "b" =>	"scroll up"
		- "q" =>  "exit read mode"
	- find entry for `-d`
	- press `q` (exit file-read)


## execute
`rm -d hello`

	execitable  option          argument
	"remove"    "a directory"   "hello"

- options are always specified with a `-`
- we should have succeeded this time in deleting `hello`
- check using `ls .`


## FUN FACT
- dont do this!
- `sudo rm -rf .`
- if you do this at the top-level directory of a computer, it will delete EVERYTHING
