<pre># What is the terminal and why do we need it?

length: 10-15 mins

## all technology has an interface

our interaction with macs mainly depends on these three components:

<ul class="fragment">
	<li>keyboards</li>
	<li>mice</li>
	<li>screen</li>
</ul>	


## compare to household object(s)

- microwave
	- LED display, buttons, dials, etc
- smartphone
	- touchscreen, buttons, microphone
- ask students

## there are two ways to interfact with our macs
- Graphic User Interface
	- keyboard, screen, mouse simultaneously
	- graphic-based interface
		- layered windows
		- clicking on the screen makes stuff happen

- Command Line Interface
	- only keyboard and screen
	- text-based interface
		- clicking on the screen DOES NOT make stuff happen


## each interface is better suited for different tasks
- GUI
	- great for visual content
		- photos
		- videos
		- forms
		- use fb page as example
	- learning curve is much smaller than the CLI

- CLI
	- no input restrictions
		- i can surf the web, delete my hard drive, edit text</pre>
