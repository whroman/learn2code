<pre># Our First Commands

new executables: `open` + `ls`

length: 10-15 mins

## our first command: open
1. open terminal
2. type `open .`
3. press "enter"

we just **executed** our first **command**!

in other words, you typed something into your terminal and pressed "enter"

think of **commands** as **sentences for computers**

dissecting `open .`

| language      | sentence
| ------------- | ---
| bash					| `open .`
| english				| "open with Finder"  "this directory"
| generalized 	| "take this action" "onto this"
| linguistic  	| "verb" "prepositional phrase"
| computer sci 	| "executable" "argument"


## what is a "command"?
- we can perform actions in a terminal by "executing commands"

- a **command** is composed of three parts:
	- `executable`
	- `arguments`
	- `options`

- we'll only deal with `executables` and `arguments` for now

- the parts of a command are *separated by spaces*, just like in written english


## the executable

`open .`

- the first part of any command is the **executable**
- for this command, the executable is `open`
- think of **executables** as the **verbs** of the CLI
- an executable is the action that we want to occur


## the argument

`open .`

- in this command, the `.` is called an **argument**
- think of **arguments** as the **nouns** of the CLI
	- an **argument** describes what we want to act upon with our **executable** (aka **verb**)


## execute `ls .`
- L i S t
- compare the terminal output with the Finder dir
- translation to english: **<list the contents of> <this directory>**
- now we've seen two different commands, `open` and `ls`, use `.` as an argument
