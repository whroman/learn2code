				# exploring the file system
new execs in this lesson: `cd` + `touch` + `man` + `rm`

length: 30-40 mins

#HSLIDE

## what is a file system?

- a collection of files and directories
- directories can only hold files or other directories
- `Finder` is probably how you&#39;re most familiar to getting around a file system
 - show example with finder
- in the terminal, we have to use commands in order to navigate the file system
- in this lesson we&#39;ll learn how to do this!
- open your terminal!

#HSLIDE

## execute
`ls .`

see the dirs and files of your current dir

#HSLIDE

## execute
`cd Documents`


- `cd` stands for &quot;change directory&quot;
- english translation: &quot;change directory to&quot; &quot;Documents&quot;

#HSLIDE

## execute
`ls .`


- see the dirs and files of `Documents`
- compare to Finder

#HSLIDE

## execute
`cd ../`


- english translation: &quot;change directory to&quot; &quot;parent directory&quot;
- family relationships are used to describe file systems:
 - parent, child, sibling
 - show example of each relationship in Finder
- now we&#39;re in the same dir that we started

#HSLIDE

## execute
`ls .`

now we see that these are the same files and dirs that we had when we began

#HSLIDE

## creating and deleting files

- execute `touch hello.txt`
- english translation: &quot;create a file&quot; &quot;called hello.txt&quot; 

#HSLIDE

## was hello.txt was really created?
how can we check?

<ul class="fragment">
    <li>execute <code>ls .</code></li>
    <li>view in finder</li>
</ul>    


#HSLIDE

## execute
`rm hello.txt`

english translation: &quot;ReMove&quot; &quot;hello.txt&quot;

so...how can we make sure this file was deleted?

<div class="fragment">same as before!</div>


#HSLIDE

## command history

- you can press the &quot;up arrow&quot; key to cycle back through your history of executed commads
- use &quot;down arrow&quot; to cycle forward

#HSLIDE

## errors are your friend

- cycle through your history and get to the command `rm hello.txt`
- execute it
- the result is error: execute `rm: foo.txt: No such file or directory`
- we were telling the terminal to delete a file that doesnt exist, so the terminal let us know that this file doesnt exist

#HSLIDE

## creating directories

- execute `ls .`
 - we&#39;re going to create a new directory, so we want to make sure that it doesnt exist yet in our file system
- execute `mkdir hello`
 - english translation: &quot;create a directory&quot; &quot;called &#39;hello&#39;&quot;

#HSLIDE

## command history
use terminal history (&quot;up arrow&quot;) to get to `ls .` and execute it

make sure that the `hello` dir is there

#HSLIDE

## attempt to delete a directory
execute `rm hello`


- english translation: &quot;remove&quot; &quot;hello&quot;&gt;
- `rm: hello/: is a directory`
- what do we do...?

#HSLIDE

## execute
`man &lt;exec&gt;`


- english translation: &quot;show me the MANual for&quot; &quot;any executable&quot;
- lets use `man` to find out if we can use `rm` to delete dirs
- execute `man rm`
 - we&#39;re in a file-read mode!
 - this used to freak me out! i didnt know how to get out of it or what it was!
 - interface:
  - &quot;space bar&quot; =&gt; &quot;scroll down&quot;
  - &quot;b&quot; =&gt;    &quot;scroll up&quot;
  - &quot;q&quot; =&gt;  &quot;exit read mode&quot;
 - find entry for `-d`
 - press `q` (exit file-read)

#HSLIDE

## execute
`rm -d hello`

```
execitable  option          argument
"remove"    "a directory"   "hello"
```

- options are always specified with a `-`
- we should have succeeded this time in deleting `hello`
- check using `ls .`

#HSLIDE

## FUN FACT

- dont do this!
- `sudo rm -rf .`
- if you do this at the top-level directory of a computer, it will delete EVERYTHING
